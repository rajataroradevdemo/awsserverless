# Build your own Serverless Food Delivery App in 3 hours!

Goal: Leverage AWS Serverless services to build a simple food delivery app in less than 3 hours!

In this workshop, we will understand how easy & quick it is to build real-world applications using Serverless on AWS and understand the various
services that can be leveraged. The application will present users with a React user interface for ordering food items. The interface on the
backend with RESTful and WebSocket services will accept the request, and find and dispatch food to the requesterâ€™s location. The application will
also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before ordering food.
